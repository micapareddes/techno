# Techno - Vue.js Project

## About the Project

Techno is the first project created during the Vue.js course by Origamid. It is an e-commerce website that simulates an electronics store. The primary goal of this project was to understand and practice the core concepts of Vue.js, eventually leading to more advanced usage with components.

The project focuses on implementing a shopping cart for users to browse and purchase products, alongside other features that explore Vue.js fundamentals.

## Features

- Open a modal to show detailed product information and user reviews.

- Add products to the shopping cart.

- Open a shopping cart modal displaying selected items and the total amount.

- Remove items from the shopping cart.

- Stock information is fetched from a mock API. When an item is out of stock, the "Add to Cart" button is disabled, and an "Out of Stock" message is displayed.
